But one need not accept any of the usual claims about issues of gender identity and gender dysphoria to relate to the human tragedy behind Teena Brandon's life and death as depicted in \"Boys Don't Cry.\" Remember that the classic definition of tragedy is not merely the unfolding of a sad event; it is the inevitability of disappointment, defeat and ultimately death as innate parts of the human experience that none of us can avoid. From that point of view this film, and Teena Brandon's life, are tragedies we can all relate to.",{"neg":0.198,"pos":0.033,"compound":-0.9956,"neu":0.77}],[5.0,"Finding Nemo [VHS] Wanted to see this again and got if for a good price.

The first half-dozen episodes are a basically continuous little arc which finds the station itself occupied by the Federation's enemies, and the cast split in half -- some of them depart the station to carry on the war with the fascist Dominion, while others remain on Deep Space Nine as a resistance against the occupation.That makes the first few episodes exciting drama, but keep in mind that the Dominion War was never more than an efficient Second World War-style conflict in space, with little or no dramatic subtext or relevence, and the consequences of the war never quite reach our heroes. The Dominion themselves were static bad guys, obsessed with conquering the galaxy, and they never develop beyond that defining trait. This entire arc is ultimately disappointing, because it never goes quite as far as it could. The show's plodding style and dreary music certainly don't help amp up the suspense.The following episodes of the season descend into DS9's usual mishmash of comedic Ferengi-centric buffoonery and generic sci-fi nonsense, with many holographic adventures and run-ins with various villains, and plenty of bland soap opera from the main cast. Worf and Jadzia Dax get married, which is a bad move for both of them; Odo and Kira fall in love, which was likewise ill-conceived; a holographic lounge singer listens to the crew's problems. The war is all but forgotten, and moves forwards from time to time in jarring fits and starts, such as the season finale which sees Jadzia murdered by the series' villain, and some setbacks for the rest of the cast. This all could have been built up much better, if the writers/producers had only bothered to plan out their show and invest it with some kind of structure.A few good episodes arrive in the middle of the mess: in \"Far Beyond the Stars\" Captain Sisko has visions from the godlike Prophets that cast him in the role of a 1950's science fiction writer, and he experiences racism for the first time on Star Trek. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the ongoing story of the series, but it's a good hour of television anyway and it's fun to see the cast playing different roles without their alien make-up. It's a classic sort of Trek episode almost lost amid all the war and bustle.Special features include a number of interviews with actors, writers, and producers, and features on Dax and other characters. There are no commentaries, which is unfortunate.

This fact is obscured by the much more pungent fact that they are victims of Genre. The director's insulated obsession with horror films has him forcing the Sibling Spooks to burp their way across town, up elevator shafts, down stairwells, through cell phones and even once in the window reflection of a public transit vehicle.Their bad manners are not the only shenanigans the poor devils are forced to perform. They are both made to alternate between \"hiding under the bed\" and \"hiding in the attic\" - both being locations in which their prey never fail to fatally discover them. They are forced to wear large amounts of eyeliner and white foundation which they must remove and reapply instantly - and Spooky Sis is required to keep her hair carefully covering her face and to move with jerky motions in order to imitate the director's favorite spook from a different movie - The Ring.Even though Sis can turn herself into smoke she is still forced to crawl downstairs - because... well because crawling is spookier than walking. I guess. Also, they both have a thing for \"opening their eyes *suddenly*.\" Sis is also known for manipulating the electric circuitry of an apartment surveillance camera. Their only handicap - like a cat forced to wear a bell around its neck our two mini-spooks are required to gastro-intestinally announce their approach upon their victims. This gives the victims time to be \"horrified\" before their jaw falls off or they go catatonic.The director's task was to take this entire situation and make it scary - no easy feat considering how goofy it is. The Genre Beast forces our director to replace substance with style: film coloring, \"spooky\" soundtrack music, a pseudo-intellectual achronological sequence and stupid flat characters who walk backwards into haunted rooms.Being an American remake DVD release allows fans to say things like \"It wasn't as good as Ju-on!\" or \"Wait until the unedited directors cut comes out!\" and other booby-prize slogans (which, incidentally, obtain their purchase by referencing the same external  environment upon which this review is based and for which this review will be criticized.)

It's fast when it wants to be and some times i feel like its a mouse that has a ball of dust that needs to be cleaned but alas there is no ball.  The buttons on it are nice, but nothing great.  It's smaller then my logitech which i hate the fact it is small since i have big hands.  I would pass, for the price this thing should be priced at 30-40.. Not the 80 there asking for.  It's plain mouse, with a BF3 logo that honestly hardly ever gets seen or mentioned.  I really miss my Logitech MX510. Razer brand is just a pathetic brand of different Mouse/keyboard/headsets/etc made with cheap parts in them with a price that is sooo overpriced for there poor products with poor customer service.  Will NEVER buy from them again, i will take my 10 dollar MS mouse over this POS ANYDAY!!",{"neg":0.171,"pos":0.059,"compound":-0.9844,"neu":0.77}],[2.0,"We were disappointed.

I have heard mostly negative things about the film, so I was expecting a movie that was cheap on thrills and poorly directed. I was in for a total shock. The Ring is a creepy, well directed movie.The opening sequence is pretty much an homage to the movie \"Scream.\" Ehren Kreuger, The Ring's writer wrote Scream 3. From the opening sequence the movie hooked me. I will not give it away, but I was actually on the edge of my seat wondering what the hell was going to happen. After this well directed opening sequence, we get into the real story. Naomi Watts, an actress that should be really famous already, plays a reporter named Rachel. After a death, Rachel investigates the mysterious circumstances around the death and discovers a video tape.The less you know going in the better. So in order to not to ruin anything don't read the next paragraph....**This tape is weird. It has images of disembowelment, which is a quick flash cut. A crazy lady, and a weird little girl. If you watch it, as soon as it's over you get a phone call saying you have 7 days to live. Some weird, creepy, and somewhat scary stuff.Rachel watches it, and becomes marked for death by the unknown reaper. Now she has to race the clock to find out who's behind the tape**Here's the bottom line....I liked this film alot! The middle needed some tightening and maybe a couple more knee jerk scares. But I was cool with the movie as a whole. The ending, which is what a lot of people I spoke with before hand didn't like, was good. The audience clapped, and of course it left it open for a sequel, or sequels I should say. The movie is really creepy, and since I'm not scared easily, I wasn't scared, just along for this ride not knowing what to expect. I have been desensitized by horror flicks so I'm not easily scared. I was happy to see that this movie was not disrespectful to the Horror Genre. It could have easily been another \"Bless The Child\" or something along that line. It wasn't.The Good.....Naomi Watts is wonderful. She should be famous already, and the camera loves her.The Direction is good. Gore Verbinski's direction is tight, clean, and suspenseful without too much gore.The Writing is good, Ehren Krueger makes up for Scream 3The Imagery is creepy.The Bad....Middle part is a bit long.The Mother-Son relationship between Watts and The Weird Kid who played her son wasn't too convincing.The actor who played her son seemed like he went to the Haley Joel Osment knockoff school of acting.One more death scene would have made me satisfied completely.Worth the money?

In the desert mountains of Morocco, two little boys shoot at a tour bus while playing with a rifle that their father bought to shoot jackals that threatened their goats. In San Diego, Susan and Richard travel to Morocco to heal their marriage but encounter tragedy on a tour bus. In Mexico, the nanny and illegal immigrant Amelia attends her son's wedding but runs afoul of the law when she tries to re-enter the United States. In Tokyo, the deaf and mute teenager Chieko searches for love in all the wrong ways to overcome the fallout of her mother's suicide and her father's emotional distance.Babel (the title comes from Genesis 11 in the Bible) is a cinematic metaphor for our post-modern, global age, ambitious in scope and layered with multiple themes--family, the collision of cultures, poverty, helplessness before state power and petty bureaucrats, human estrangement, misinformation and miscommunication, international terrorism, and fate. Every component of this film--sound track (including an unforgettable scene in a Tokyo disco when the pounding music goes silent in order to simulate Chieko's deafness), scenery, narrative, and cinematography--combine for an overwhelming effect.

Jason,\" but, quite sadly, it feels more like a handful of fun sequences and tired cliches, than an all-around memorable horror experience.I will ignore the horrible acting from the 20-year old actors playing high-school kids, for that is a staple of both film series, but I will applaud Robert Englund who once again is wonderfully demented as Freddy Krueger. As the series had it's ups and downs, Mr. Englund remained wonderful as Ol' Crispy.OK, to the flaws, of which there are many. What is the title of this film? \"Freddy Vs. Jason.\" That's entirely misleading, for the Machete-one and the Clawed-one do not mingle violently until the film's last 15 minutes (Although, it is shockingly violent and reminded me of a pulpy, but funny, comic-book). A more fitting title would be \"Freddy & Jason,\" for the majority of the film they share a shaky partnership, you see.And the other gigantic flaw is the lamebrained attempt to add a mystery to the film. Did Freddy kill the lead actress' mother or did her father? Does anyone really care? This, while a tad interesting, is useless and angering to those of us expecting a fun horror ride.Ultimatley, this film amounts to a few cool action sequences, mixed in with horrid acting and cheesy mystery plots.

Along the way, or rather, after the first killing that we see in the movie, he meets someone who's apparently a photographer.The guy happened to take a picture of the killer shooting a couple... um... \"doing it\" in a bedroom.  He even positioned the bodies in a sick sexual way after killing them so the cops would see the bodies in that position when they arrived to the scene.The story gets interesting when the killer meets the guy who snapped the picture of him in the middle of the killing, because it turns out the photographer doesn't have ANY plans to turn the killer in after showing him pictures of the killing he just committed.  Instead, the photographer actually wants to go with the killer on his next \"kill job\".So the killer and the photographer go around town searching for the next victim.  This takes up a good portion of the movie, building suspense the entire time.This movie is great because it builds suspense and shows you what's it like to get inside the head of someone who has no compassion for human life.  The entire film focuses on the killer having a make-believe friend helping to convince him go through with the killings.  The invisible friend is just the voice in his head.Also, the killers daughter plays a big part in the film with some neat twists you won't see coming.Anyway, when the story gets going, the movie turns into a really solid film overall.

The performance of Swank and other actors in this film is compelling. This film certainly humanizes the complex and widely misunderstood plight of woman and men like Teena Brandon who are forced to live not only with vilification and threats from many around them, but who must ever minute of every day confront the reality that their own bodies are a living mockery of how they conceptualize themselves and their place in the world. If art is a creative endeavor that enables someone to come closer to the inner world and experiences of another, than this is indeed one of the rarest things to come out of Hollywood -- a real piece of art.As evident from many of the reviews here, this film a has become an occasion for polemics and gender identity politics among some, for displays of misinformation and confusion among others, and for both by yet others. But one need not accept any of the usual claims about issues of gender identity and gender dysphoria to relate to the human tragedy behind Teena Brandon's life and death as depicted in \"Boys Don't Cry.\" Remember that the classic definition of tragedy is not merely the unfolding of a sad event; it is the inevitability of disappointment, defeat and ultimately death as innate parts of the human experience that none of us can avoid. From that point of view this film, and Teena Brandon's life, are tragedies we can all relate to.</td><td>Map(neg -> 0.198, pos -> 0.033, compound -> -0.9956, neu -> 0.77)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Finding Nemo [VHS] Wanted to see this again and got if for a good price.

There is around 30 minutes of extra footage involving a subplot that showcases the character of Matt Murdock. This cut also retells the relationship between Elektra and Daredevil and makes it a lot more involving and a lot less gratuitous. The action scenes are extended and more violent and there are even a few more snipets of things you may have missed in the theatrical cut as a fan of the character (like Matt's mom).I still won't give it a perfect score as the scenes that didn't work for me still don't but the director's cut moves the film from an average yet faulty attempt to a legitimate vision of the character.</td><td>Map(neg -> 0.196, pos -> 0.118, compound -> -0.9551, neu -> 0.686)</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>This is a good kit basic screw driver kit, that has sizes for most screws on computer chassis.

The first half-dozen episodes are a basically continuous little arc which finds the station itself occupied by the Federation's enemies, and the cast split in half -- some of them depart the station to carry on the war with the fascist Dominion, while others remain on Deep Space Nine as a resistance against the occupation.That makes the first few episodes exciting drama, but keep in mind that the Dominion War was never more than an efficient Second World War-style conflict in space, with little or no dramatic subtext or relevence, and the consequences of the war never quite reach our heroes. The Dominion themselves were static bad guys, obsessed with conquering the galaxy, and they never develop beyond that defining trait. This entire arc is ultimately disappointing, because it never goes quite as far as it could. The show's plodding style and dreary music certainly don't help amp up the suspense.The following episodes of the season descend into DS9's usual mishmash of comedic Ferengi-centric buffoonery and generic sci-fi nonsense, with many holographic adventures and run-ins with various villains, and plenty of bland soap opera from the main cast. Worf and Jadzia Dax get married, which is a bad move for both of them; Odo and Kira fall in love, which was likewise ill-conceived; a holographic lounge singer listens to the crew's problems. The war is all but forgotten, and moves forwards from time to time in jarring fits and starts, such as the season finale which sees Jadzia murdered by the series' villain, and some setbacks for the rest of the cast. This all could have been built up much better, if the writers/producers had only bothered to plan out their show and invest it with some kind of structure.A few good episodes arrive in the middle of the mess: in \"Far Beyond the Stars\" Captain Sisko has visions from the godlike Prophets that cast him in the role of a 1950's science fiction writer, and he experiences racism for the first time on Star Trek. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the ongoing story of the series, but it's a good hour of television anyway and it's fun to see the cast playing different roles without their alien make-up. It's a classic sort of Trek episode almost lost amid all the war and bustle.Special features include a number of interviews with actors, writers, and producers, and features on Dax and other characters. There are no commentaries, which is unfortunate. STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE was a mixed up show from the beginning, never quite sure what it was about or what it wanted to accomplish, and even the much-hyped Dominion War can't quite redeem it.</td><td>Map(neg -> 0.192, pos -> 0.095, compound -> -0.996, neu -> 0.713)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>Had a problem resetting my AP, and Sam from Amped did a great job in helping me resolve the problem quickly</td><td>Map(neg -> 0.191, pos -> 0.314, compound -> 0.5423, neu -> 0.495)</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>very cute baby pink color. fit/cut is not perfect, sometimes I have trouble pressing on/off button. easy to put on and take off.</td><td>Map(neg -> 0.191, pos -> 0.207, compound -> 0.1268, neu -> 0.602)</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>for all interior lights, no heat, low low draw from battery 12Volt system and for outside patio light, well never come home in the dark just leave it on, last for a very long time and no melted lens... thank you Thurman I have purchased more .</td><td>Map(neg -> 0.191, pos -> 0.089, compound -> -0.4939, neu -> 0.72)</td></tr><tr><td>3.0</td><td>The rings were not as well made as others of the same size I have purchased.

This fact is obscured by the much more pungent fact that they are victims of Genre. The director's insulated obsession with horror films has him forcing the Sibling Spooks to burp their way across town, up elevator shafts, down stairwells, through cell phones and even once in the window reflection of a public transit vehicle.Their bad manners are not the only shenanigans the poor devils are forced to perform. They are both made to alternate between \"hiding under the bed\" and \"hiding in the attic\" - both being locations in which their prey never fail to fatally discover them. They are forced to wear large amounts of eyeliner and white foundation which they must remove and reapply instantly - and Spooky Sis is required to keep her hair carefully covering her face and to move with jerky motions in order to imitate the director's favorite spook from a different movie - The Ring.Even though Sis can turn herself into smoke she is still forced to crawl downstairs - because... well because crawling is spookier than walking. I guess. Also, they both have a thing for \"opening their eyes *suddenly*.\" Sis is also known for manipulating the electric circuitry of an apartment surveillance camera. Their only handicap - like a cat forced to wear a bell around its neck our two mini-spooks are required to gastro-intestinally announce their approach upon their victims. This gives the victims time to be \"horrified\" before their jaw falls off or they go catatonic.The director's task was to take this entire situation and make it scary - no easy feat considering how goofy it is. The Genre Beast forces our director to replace substance with style: film coloring, \"spooky\" soundtrack music, a pseudo-intellectual achronological sequence and stupid flat characters who walk backwards into haunted rooms.Being an American remake DVD release allows fans to say things like \"It wasn't as good as Ju-on!\" or \"Wait until the unedited directors cut comes out!\" and other booby-prize slogans (which, incidentally, obtain their purchase by referencing the same external  environment upon which this review is based and for which this review will be criticized.)

I contacted Asus, they said this monitor is not a \"NON-ZBD\" which means Asus does not guarantee it won't have a dead pixel upon arrival or use... This sucks because the dead pixel is very noticeable and, in my opinion, much larger in area than just one pixel. I sent a picture of the dark spot to customer service, and they said it was just one...and I completely disagree... The spot is at least a few pixels in a group, and it is in a curved shape.

Dahlia is being assaulted on three separate levels. She is haunted by the terrible memories of her childhood, dogged by the insanity of her current, ugly divorce, and plagued by the ghostly happenings in her apartment building. Dahlia and her daughter, Cecelia are in the middle of a black storm of  overwhelming forces. A combination that would drive most souls to despair, most minds to break down. Watching this poor woman go through this ordeal is downright depressing, yet Connelly plays it w/ her usual grace. DARK WATER is a supernatural mystery.

I have heard mostly negative things about the film, so I was expecting a movie that was cheap on thrills and poorly directed. I was in for a total shock. The Ring is a creepy, well directed movie.The opening sequence is pretty much an homage to the movie \"Scream.\" Ehren Kreuger, The Ring's writer wrote Scream 3. From the opening sequence the movie hooked me. I will not give it away, but I was actually on the edge of my seat wondering what the hell was going to happen. After this well directed opening sequence, we get into the real story. Naomi Watts, an actress that should be really famous already, plays a reporter named Rachel. After a death, Rachel investigates the mysterious circumstances around the death and discovers a video tape.The less you know going in the better. So in order to not to ruin anything don't read the next paragraph....**This tape is weird. It has images of disembowelment, which is a quick flash cut. A crazy lady, and a weird little girl. If you watch it, as soon as it's over you get a phone call saying you have 7 days to live. Some weird, creepy, and somewhat scary stuff.Rachel watches it, and becomes marked for death by the unknown reaper. Now she has to race the clock to find out who's behind the tape**Here's the bottom line....I liked this film alot! The middle needed some tightening and maybe a couple more knee jerk scares. But I was cool with the movie as a whole. The ending, which is what a lot of people I spoke with before hand didn't like, was good. The audience clapped, and of course it left it open for a sequel, or sequels I should say. The movie is really creepy, and since I'm not scared easily, I wasn't scared, just along for this ride not knowing what to expect. I have been desensitized by horror flicks so I'm not easily scared. I was happy to see that this movie was not disrespectful to the Horror Genre. It could have easily been another \"Bless The Child\" or something along that line. It wasn't.The Good.....Naomi Watts is wonderful. She should be famous already, and the camera loves her.The Direction is good. Gore Verbinski's direction is tight, clean, and suspenseful without too much gore.The Writing is good, Ehren Krueger makes up for Scream 3The Imagery is creepy.The Bad....Middle part is a bit long.The Mother-Son relationship between Watts and The Weird Kid who played her son wasn't too convincing.The actor who played her son seemed like he went to the Haley Joel Osment knockoff school of acting.One more death scene would have made me satisfied completely.Worth the money?

It seems like Lifeproof spent a bunch of time on the case and the screen protector was an after thought. All other complaints I have read about have not affected my experience at all with the case. No muffled sounds, no complaints of people I am talking to on the phone, no issues with headphone jack, etc. However, I would highly recommend getting a different product other than this Lifeproof case based on the screen protector alone.

I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu connects four deeply human stories by the tragic and unintended consequences of a random act. In the desert mountains of Morocco, two little boys shoot at a tour bus while playing with a rifle that their father bought to shoot jackals that threatened their goats. In San Diego, Susan and Richard travel to Morocco to heal their marriage but encounter tragedy on a tour bus. In Mexico, the nanny and illegal immigrant Amelia attends her son's wedding but runs afoul of the law when she tries to re-enter the United States. In Tokyo, the deaf and mute teenager Chieko searches for love in all the wrong ways to overcome the fallout of her mother's suicide and her father's emotional distance.Babel (the title comes from Genesis 11 in the Bible) is a cinematic metaphor for our post-modern, global age, ambitious in scope and layered with multiple themes--family, the collision of cultures, poverty, helplessness before state power and petty bureaucrats, human estrangement, misinformation and miscommunication, international terrorism, and fate. Every component of this film--sound track (including an unforgettable scene in a Tokyo disco when the pounding music goes silent in order to simulate Chieko's deafness), scenery, narrative, and cinematography--combine for an overwhelming effect. Give your heart and mind to this film and its characters, and you will leave the theater on mental, spiritual, and emotional overload. In Moroccan Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, English, sign language, written notes, cell phone video and text-message, and English sub-titles (so that in many scenes the viewer knows more than the characters who do not or cannot understand what is happening).</td><td>Map(neg -> 0.165, pos -> 0.06, compound -> -0.9897, neu -> 0.775)</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>Ok not the best camera but there is nothing wrong with it.

Great chair, especially for the price.When putting it together, you should screw in the back screw of the arm rest first, before screwing in the 2 bottom screws.

It was difficult to screw in, but the alignments, bolts, & holes were in fact perfect ;^)One reviewer claimed the recliner doesn't hold it's position...they must have missed the big knob to the left that is easily adjustable.As for the 2 bottom bolts, it takes some effort & muscle to align the holes, but that's just b/c the chair is durable and precise.Anyone who claimed this chair is hard to put together or is defective, must be lazy and has never built anything, even IKEA furniture. Take a deep breath, concentrate, work slow, and expect to spend 60 mins. to build.
